# MNIST Handwritten Digits Classification

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using PyTorch. The notebook includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, achieving an accuracy of **over 97%** on the test set.

## Features
- **Data Loading & Preprocessing**: Uses PyTorch to load and normalize the MNIST dataset.
- **Neural Network Architecture**:
  - Input layer (784 neurons)
  - Two hidden layers (256 and 128 neurons) with ReLU activation and dropout
  - Output layer (10 neurons for digit classification)
- **Training**: 
  - Cross-entropy loss function
  - Adam optimizer
- **Evaluation**: High accuracy on both training and test sets.
- **Visualization**: 
  - Sample digit visualization
  - Training/validation loss plots

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib
- numpy
- tqdm

## Usage
1. Open the notebook `MNIST_Handwritten_Digits-STARTER.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab.
2. Run cells sequentially to:
   - Load and preprocess data
   - Define and train the neural network
   - Evaluate model performance
   - Visualize results

## Results
| Metric          | Performance |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Training Acc    | ~97.7%      |
| Validation Acc  | ~97.7%      |
| Test Accuracy   | **97.9%**   |

## Customization
- Adjust hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, etc.)
- Modify network architecture
- Experiment with different optimizers or loss functions

### Key Features:
1. Clean markdown formatting with headers and sections
2. Table for clear results presentation
3. Placeholder for visualization (replace with actual image later)
4. MIT license badge (common for ML projects)
5. Simple installation and usage instructions

You can add actual screenshots of your results by:
1. Saving plots as PNG files
2. Uploading them to your repo
3. Updating the image links in the markdown

Would you like me to modify any section or add more details?
